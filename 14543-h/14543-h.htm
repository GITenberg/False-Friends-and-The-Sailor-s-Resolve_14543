<p>&quot;Philip, your conduct has distressed
me exceedingly,&quot; said Lady Grange,
laying her hand on the arm of her
son, as they entered together the elegant
apartment which had been fitted up as her
boudoir. &quot;You could not but know my feelings
towards those two men&mdash;I will not call
them gentlemen&mdash;whose company you have
again forced upon me. You must be aware
that your father has shut the door of this
house against them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My father has shut the door against
better men than they are,&quot; said the youth
carelessly; &quot;witness my own uncles Henry
and George.&quot;</p>

<p>The lip of the lady quivered, the indignant
colour rose even to her temples; she
attempted to speak, but her voice failed
her, and she turned aside to hide her emotion.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, mother, I did not mean to vex
you,&quot; said Philip, who was rather weak in
purpose than hardened in evil; &quot;it <i>was</i> a
shame to bring Jones and Wildrake here, but&mdash;but
you see I couldn't help it.&quot; And he
played uneasily with his gold-headed riding-whip,
while his eye avoided meeting that of
his mother.</p>

<p>&quot;They have acquired some strange influence,
some mysterious hold over you,&quot;
answered the lady. &quot;It cannot be,&quot; she
added anxiously, &quot;that you have broken
your promise,&mdash;that they have drawn you
again to the gaming-table,&mdash;that you are involved
in debt to these men?&quot;</p>

<p>Philip whistled an air and sauntered up
to the window.</p>

<p>Lady Grange pressed her hand over her
eyes, and a sigh, a very heavy sigh, burst
from her bosom. Philip heard, and turned
impatiently round.</p>

<p>&quot;There's no use in making the worst of
matters,&quot; said he; &quot;what's done can't be
helped; and my debts, such as they are, won't
ruin a rich man like my father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not that which I fear,&quot; said the
mother faintly, with a terrible consciousness
that her son,&mdash;her hope, her pride, the delight
of her heart,&mdash;had entered on a course which,
if persevered in, must end in his ruin both
of body and soul. &quot;I tremble at the thought
of the misery which you are bringing on
yourself. These men are making you their
victim: they are blinding your eyes; they
are throwing a net around you, and you have
not the resolution to break from the snare.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are very pleasant, jovial fellows!&quot;
cried Philip, trying to hide under an appearance
of careless gaiety the real annoyance
which he felt at the words of his mother.</p>

<p>&quot;I've asked them to dine here to-day
and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not appear at the table,&quot; said
Lady Grange, drawing herself up with dignity;
&quot;and if your father should arrive&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! he won't arrive to-night; he never
travels so late.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Philip,&quot; said the lady earnestly
again laying her cold hand on his arm. She
was interrupted by her wayward and undutiful
son.</p>

<p>&quot;Mother, there's no use in saying anything
more on the subject; it only worries you, and
puts me out of temper. I can't, and I won't
be uncivil to my friends;&quot; and turning
hastily round, Philip quitted the apartment.</p>

<p>&quot;Friends!&quot; faintly echoed Lady Grange,
as she saw the door close behind her misguided
son. &quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed, throwing
herself on a sofa, and burying her face,
&quot;was there ever a mother&mdash;ever a woman
so unhappy as I am!&quot;</p>

<p>Her cup was indeed very bitter; it was
one which the luxuries that surrounded
her had not the least power to sweeten.
Her husband was a man possessing many
noble qualities both of head and heart; but
the fatal love of gold, like those petrifying
springs which change living twigs to dead
stone, had made him hardened, quarrelsome,
and worldly. It had drawn him away from
the worship of his God; for there is deep
truth in the declaration of the apostle, that
the covetous man is <i>an idolater</i>. It was
this miserable love of gold which had induced
Sir Gilbert to break with the family
of his wife, and separate her from those to
whom her loving heart still clung with the
fondest affection. Lady Grange yearned for
a sight of her early home; but gold had
raised a barrier between her and the companions
of her childhood. And what had
the possession of gold done for the man who
made it his idol? It had put snares in the
path of his only son; it had made the weak-minded
but head-strong youth be entrapped
by the wicked for the sake of his wealth, as
the ermine is hunted down for its rich fur.
It had given to himself heavy responsibilities,
for which he would have to answer at
the bar of Heaven; for from him unto whom
much has been given, much at the last day
will be required.</p>

<p>Yes, Lady Grange was very miserable.
And how did she endeavour to lighten the
burden of her misery? Was it by counting
over her jewels,&mdash;looking at the costly and
beautiful things which adorned her dwelling,&mdash;thinking
of her carriages and horses and
glittering plate, or the number of her rich
and titled friends? No; she sought comfort
where Widow Green had sought it when her
child lay dangerously ill, and there was
neither a loaf on her shelf nor a penny in
her purse. The rich lady did what the poor
one had done,&mdash;she fell on her knees and
with tears poured out her heart to the merciful
Father of all. She told him her sorrows,
she told him her fears; she asked him for
that help which she so much required. Her
case was a harder one than the widow's. A
visit from the clergyman, a present from a
benevolent friend, God's blessing on a simple
remedy, had soon changed Mrs. Green's sorrow
into joy. The anguish of Lady Grange
lay deeper; her faith was more sorely tried;
her fears were not for the bodies but the
souls of those whom she loved;&mdash;and where
is the mortal who can give us a cure for the
disease of sin?</p>

<p>While his mother was weeping and praying,
Philip was revelling and drinking. Fast
were the bottles pushed round, and often
were the glasses refilled. The stately banqueting-room
resounded with laughter and
merriment; and as the evening advanced,
with boisterous song. It was late before the
young men quitted the table; and then,
heated with wine, they threw the window
wide open, to let the freshness of the night
air cool their fevered temples.</p>

<p>Beautiful looked the park in the calm
moonlight. Not a breath stirred the branches
of the trees, their dark shadows lay motionless
on the green sward: perfect silence and
stillness reigned around. But the holy quietness
of nature was rudely disturbed by the
voices of the revellers.</p>

<p>With the conversation that passed I shall
not soil my pages. The window opened into
a broad stone balcony, and seating themselves
upon its parapet, the young men exchanged
stories and jests. After many sallies of so-called
wit, Wildrake rallied Philip on the
quantity of wine which he had taken, and
betted that he could not walk steadily from
the one end of the balcony to the other.
Philip, with that insane pride which can
plume itself on being <i>mighty to mingle strong
drink</i>, maintained that his head was as clear
and his faculties as perfect as though he had
tasted nothing but water; and declared that
he could walk round the edge of the parapet
with as steady a step as he would tread the
gravel-path in the morning!</p>

<p>Wildrake laughed, and dared him to do
it: Jones betted ten to one that he could not.</p>

<p>&quot;Done!&quot; cried Philip, and sprang up on
the parapet in a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Come down again!&quot; called out Wildrake,
who had enough of sense left to perceive
the folly and danger of the wager.</p>

<p>Philip did not appear to hear him. Attempting
to balance himself by his arms,
with a slow and unsteady step he began to
make his way along the lofty and narrow
edge.</p>

<p>The two young men held their breath.
To one who with unsteady feet walks the
slippery margin of temptation, the higher
his position, the greater his danger; the
loftier his elevation, the more perilous a fall!</p>

<p>&quot;He will never get to the end!&quot; said
Jones, watching with some anxiety the
movements of his companion.</p>

<p>The words had scarcely escaped his lips
when they received a startling fulfilment.
Philip had not proceeded half way along
the parapet when a slight sound in the garden
below him attracted his attention. He
glanced down for a moment; and there, in
the cold, clear moonlight, gazing sternly
upon him, he beheld his father! The sudden
start of surprise which he gave threw
the youth off his balance,&mdash;he staggered
back, lost his footing, stretched out his
hands wildly to save himself, and fell with
a loud cry to the ground!</p>

<p>All was now confusion and terror. There
were the rushing of footsteps hither and
thither, voices calling, bells loudly ringing,
and, above all, the voice of a mother's
anguish, piercing to the soul! Jones and
Wildrake hurried off to the stables, saddled
their horses themselves, and dashed off at
full speed to summon a surgeon, glad of any
excuse to make their escape from the place.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Philip was raised from
the ground, and carried into the house. His
groans showed the severity of his sufferings.
The slightest motion was to him torture, and
an hour of intense suspense ensued before
the arrival of the surgeon. Lady Grange
made a painful effort to be calm. She
thought of everything, did all that she could
do for the relief of her son, and even strove
to speak words of comfort and hope to her
husband, who appeared almost stupified by
his sorrow. Prayer was still her support&mdash;prayer,
silent, but almost unceasing.</p>

<p>The surgeon arrived,&mdash;the injuries received
by the sufferer were examined, though it was
long before Philip, unaccustomed to pain and
incapable of self-control, would permit necessary
measures to be taken. His resistance
greatly added to his sufferings. He had sustained
a compound fracture of his leg, besides
numerous bruises and contusions. The broken
bone had to be set, and the pale mother stood
by, longing, in the fervour of her unselfish
love, that she could endure the agony in the
place of her son. The pampered child of
luxury shrank sensitively from pain, and the
thought that he had brought all his misery
upon himself by his folly and disobedience
rendered it yet more intolerable. When
the surgeon had at length done his work,
Lady Grange retired with him to another
apartment, and, struggling to command
her choking voice, asked him the question
on the reply to which all her earthly
happiness seemed to hang,&mdash;whether he had
hope that the life of her boy might be
spared.</p>

<p>&quot;I have every hope&quot;, said the surgeon,
cheerfully, &quot;if we can keep down the fever.&quot;
Then, for the first time since she had seen
her son lie bleeding before her, the mother
found the relief of tears.</p>

<p>Through the long night she quitted not
the sufferer's pillow, bathing his fevered
brow, relieving his thirst, whispering comfort
to his troubled spirit. Soon after daybreak
Philip sank into a quiet, refreshing sleep;
and Lady Grange, feeling as if a mountain's
weight had been lifted from her heart, hurried
to carry the good news to her husband.</p>

<p>She found him in the spacious saloon,
pacing restlessly to and fro. His brow was
knit, his lips compressed; his disordered
dress and haggard countenance showed that
he, too, had watched the live-long night.</p>

<p>&quot;He sleeps at last, Gilbert, thank God!&quot;
Her face brightened as she spoke; but there
was no corresponding look of joy on that of
her husband.</p>

<p>&quot;Gilbert, the doctor assures me that there
is every prospect of our dear boy's restoration!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And to what is he to be restored?&quot; said
the father gloomily; &quot;to poverty&mdash;misery&mdash;ruin!&quot;</p>

<p>Lady Grange stood mute with surprise
scarcely believing the evidence of her senses
almost deeming that the words must have
been uttered in a dream. But it was no
dream, but one of those strange, stern realities
which we meet with in life. Her husband
indeed stood before her a ruined man! A
commercial crash, like those which have so
often reduced the rich to poverty, coming
almost as suddenly as the earthquake which
shakes the natural world, had overthrown
all his fortune! The riches in which he had
trusted had taken to themselves wings and
flown away.</p>

<p>Here was another startling shock, but
Lady Grange felt it far less than the first.
It seemed to her that if her son were only
spared to her, she could bear cheerfully any
other trial. When riches had increased, she
had not set her heart upon them; she had
endeavoured to spend them as a good steward
of God and to lay up treasure in that blessed
place where there is no danger of its ever
being lost. Sir Gilbert was far more crushed
than his wife was by this misfortune. He
saw his idol broken before his eyes, and
where was he to turn for comfort? Everything
upon which his eye rested was a source
of pain to him; for must he not part with
all, leave all in which his heart had delighted,
all in which his soul had taken
pride? He forgot that poverty was only
forestalling by a few years the inevitable
work of death!</p>

<p>The day passed wearily away. Philip
suffered much pain, was weak and low, and
bitterly conscious how well he had earned
the misery which he was called on to endure.
It was a mercy that he was experiencing,
before it was too late, that <i>thorns and snares
are in the way of the froward</i>. He liked his
mother to read the Bible to him, just a few
verses at a time, as he had strength to bear
it; and in this occupation she herself found
the comfort which she needed. Sir Gilbert,
full of his own troubles, scarcely ever entered
the apartment of his son.</p>

<p>Towards evening a servant came softly
into the sick-room, bringing a sealed letter
for her lady. There was no post-mark upon
it, and the girl informed her mistress that
the gentleman who had brought it was
waiting in the garden for a reply. The first
glance at the hand-writing, at the well-known
seal, brought colour to the cheek of the lady.
But it was a hand-writing which she had
been forbidden to read; it was a seal which
she must not break! She motioned to the
maid to take her place beside the invalid
who happened at that moment to be sleeping
and with a quick step and a throbbing heart
she hurried away to find her husband.</p>

<p>He was in his study, his arms resting on
his open desk, and his head bowed down
upon them. Bills and papers, scattered in
profusion on the table, showed what had
been the nature of the occupation which
he had not had the courage to finish. He
started from his posture of despair as his
wife laid a gentle touch on his shoulder; and,
without uttering a word, she placed the
unopened letter in his hand.</p>

<p>My reader shall have the privilege of looking
over Sir Gilbert's shoulder, and perusing
the contents of that letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 100%">
&quot;Dearest Sister</span>,&mdash;We have heard of
your trials, and warmly sympathize in your
sorrow. Let Sir Gilbert know that we have
placed at his banker's, after having settled it
upon you, double the sum which caused our
unhappy differences. Let the past be forgotten;
let us again meet as those should
meet who have gathered together round the
same hearth, mourned over the same grave,
and shared joys and sorrows together, as it
is our anxious desire to do now. I shall be
my own messenger, and shall wait in person
to receive your reply.&mdash;Your ever attached
brother,</p>

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 100%">
&quot;Henry Latour.</span>&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>A few minutes more and Lady Grange was
in the arms of her brother; while Sir Gilbert
was silently grasping the hand of one whom,
but for misfortune, he would never have
known as a friend.</p>

<p>All the neighbourhood pitied the gentle
lady, the benefactress of the poor, when she
dismissed her servants, sold her jewels, and
quitted her beautiful home to seek a humbler
shelter. Amongst the hundreds who crowded
to the public auction of the magnificent furniture
and plate, which had been the admiration
of all who had seen them, many thought with
compassion of the late owners, reduced to such
sudden poverty, though the generosity of the
lady's family had saved them from want or
dependence.</p>

<p>And yet truly, never since her marriage
had Lady Grange been less an object of compassion.</p>

<p>Her son was slowly but surely recovering,
and his preservation from meeting sudden
death unprepared was to her a source of
unutterable thankfulness. Her own family
appeared to regard her with even more tender
affection than if no coldness had ever arisen
between them; and their love was to her
beyond price. Even Sir Gilbert's harsh,
worldly character, was somewhat softened
by trials, and by the unmerited kindness
which he met with from those whom, in his
prosperity, he had slighted and shunned.
Lady Grange felt that her prayers had been
answered indeed, though in a way very
different from what she had hoped or expected.
The chain by which her son had
been gradually drawn down towards rum,
by those who sought his company for the
sake of his money, had been suddenly snapped
by the loss of his fortune. The weak youth
was left to the guidance of those to whom
his welfare was really dear. Philip, obliged
to rouse himself from his indolence, and
exert himself to earn his living, became a
far wiser and more estimable man than he
would ever have been as the heir to a fortune;
and he never forgot the lesson which pain,
weakness, and shame had taught him,&mdash;that
the way of evil is also the way of sorrow.
<i>Thorns and snares are in the way of the
froward.</i></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em; text-align: center;">
&quot;An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in
transgression.&quot;&mdash;PROV. xxix. 22.</p>

<br />

<p>The old sailor Jonas sat before the fire
with his pipe in his mouth, looking
steadfastly into the glowing coals.
Not that, following a favourite practice of
his little niece, he was making out red-hot
castles and flaming buildings in the grate, or
that his thoughts were in any way connected
with the embers: he was doing what it would
be well if we all sometimes did,&mdash;looking
into himself, and reflecting on what had
happened in relation to his own conduct.</p>

<p>&quot;So,&quot; thought he, &quot;here am I, an honest
old fellow,&mdash;I may say it, with all my faults;
and one who shrinks from falsehood more
than from fire; and I find that I, with my
bearish temper, am actually driving those
about me into it&mdash;teaching them to be crafty,
tricky, and cowardly! I knew well enough
that my gruffness plagued others, but I never
saw how it <i>tempted</i> others until now; tempted
them to meanness, I would say, for I have
found a thousand times that <i>an angry man
stirreth up strife</i>, and that a short word may
begin a long quarrel. I am afraid that I
have not thought enough on this matter.
I've looked on bad temper as a very little
sin, and I begin to suspect that it is a great
one, both in God's eyes and in the consequences
that it brings. Let me see if I can
reckon up its evils! It makes those miserable
whom one would wish to make happy;
it often, like an adverse gale, forces them to
back, instead of steering straight for the
port. It dishonours one's profession, lowers
one's flag, makes the world mock at the
religion which can leave a man as rough and
rugged as a heathen savage. It's directly
contrary to the Word of God,&mdash;it's wide as
east from west of the example set before us!
Yes, a furious temper is a very evil thing;
I'd give my other leg to be rid of mine!&quot; and
in the warmth of his self-reproach the sailor
struck his wooden one against the hearth
with such violence as to make Alie start in
terror that some fierce explosion was about
to follow.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I've made up my mind as to its
being an evil&mdash;a great evil,&quot; continued Jonas,
in his quiet meditation; &quot;the next question
is, how is the evil to be got rid of? There's
the pinch! It clings to one like one's skin.
It's one's nature,&mdash;how can one fight against
nature? And yet, I take it, it's the very
business of faith to conquer our evil nature.
As I read somewhere, any dead dog can float
with the stream; it's the living dog that swims
against it. I mind the trouble I had about
the wicked habit of swearing, when first I
took to trying to serve God and leave off my
evil courses. Bad words came to my mouth
as natural as the very air that I breathed.
What did I do to cure myself of that evil?
Why, I resolved again and again, and found
that my resolutions were always snapping
like a rotten cable in a storm; and I was
driven from my anchorage so often, that I
almost began to despair. Then I prayed
hard to be helped; and I said to myself,
'God helps those who help themselves, and
maybe if I determine to do something that
I should be sorry to do every time that
an oath comes from my mouth, it would
assist me to remember my duty.' I resolved
to break my pipe the first time that I swore;
and I've never uttered an oath from that
day to this, not even in my most towering
passions! Now I'll try the same cure again;
not to punish a sin, but to prevent it. If I
fly into a fury, I'll break my pipe! There
Jonas Colter, I give you fair warning!&quot;
and the old sailor smiled grimly to himself,
and stirred the fire with an air of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Not one rough word did Jonas utter that
evening; indeed he was remarkably silent,
for the simplest way of saying nothing evil,
he thought, was to say nothing at all. Jonas
looked with much pleasure at his pipe when
he put it on the mantle-piece for the night.
&quot;You've weathered this day, old friend,&quot;
said he; &quot;we'll be on the look out against
squalls to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>The next morning Jonas occupied himself
in his own room with his phials, and his
nephew and niece were engaged in the
kitchen in preparing for the Sunday school,
which their mother made, them regularly
attend. The door was open between the two
rooms and as the place was not large, Jonas
heard every word that passed between
Johnny and Alie almost as well as if he had
been close beside them.</p>

<p><i>Johnny</i>. I say, Alie&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Alie</i>. Please, Johnny, let me learn this
quietly. If I do not know it my teacher will
be vexed. My work being behind-hand yesterday
has put me quite back with my tasks.
You know that I cannot learn so fast as
you do.</p>

<p><i>Johnny</i>. Oh! you've plenty of time. I
want you to do something for me. Do you
know that I have lost my new ball?</p>

<p><i>Alie</i>. Why, I saw you take it out of your
pocket yesterday, just after we crossed the
stile on our way back from the farm.</p>

<p><i>Johnny</i>. That's it! I took it out of my
pocket, and I never put it in again. I want
you to go directly and look for the ball.
That stile is only three fields off, you know.
You must look carefully along the path all
the way; and lose no time, or some one else
may pick it up.</p>

<p><i>Alie</i>. Pray, Johnny, don't ask me to go
into the fields.</p>

<p><i>Johnny</i>. I tell you, you have plenty of
time for your lessons.</p>

<p><i>Alie</i>. It is not that, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Johnny</i>. Speak out, will you?</p>

<p><i>Alie</i>. You know&mdash;there are&mdash;cows!</p>

<p>Johnny burst into a loud, coarse laugh of
derision. &quot;You miserable little coward!&quot; he
cried; &quot;I'd like to see one chasing you round
the meadow! How you'd scamper! how
you'd scream! rare fun it would be,&mdash;ha!
ha! ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rare fun would it be, sir!&quot; exclaimed an
indignant voice, as Jonas stumped from the
next room, and, seizing his nephew by the
collar of his jacket, gave him a hearty shake;
&quot;rare fun would it be,&mdash;and what do you call
this? You dare twit your sister with cowardice!&mdash;you
who sneaked off yesterday like a
fox because you had not the spirit to look an
old man in the face!&mdash;you who bully the
weak and cringe to the strong!&mdash;you who
have the manners of a bear with the heart
of a pigeon!&quot; Every sentence was accompanied
by a violent shake, which almost
took the breath from the boy; and Jonas,
red with passion, concluded his speech by
flinging Johnny from him with such force
that, but for the wall against which he staggered,
he must have fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>The next minute Jonas walked up to the
mantle-piece, and exclaiming, in a tone of
vexation, &quot;Run aground again!&quot; took his
pipe, snapped it in two, and flung the pieces
into the fire! He then stumped back to his
room, slamming the door behind him.</p>

<p>&quot;The old fury!&quot; muttered the panting
Johnny between his clenched teeth, looking
fiercely towards his uncle's room.</p>

<p>&quot;To break his own pipe!&quot; exclaimed Alie.
&quot;I never knew him do anything like that
before, however angry he might be!&quot;</p>

<p>Johnny took down his cap from its peg,
and, in as ill humour as can well be imagined,
went out to search for his ball. He took
what revenge he could on his formidable
uncle, while amusing himself that afternoon
by looking over his &quot;Robinson Crusoe.&quot;
Johnny was fond of his pencil, though he
had never learned to draw; and the margins
of his books were often adorned with grim
heads or odd figures by his hand. There
was a picture in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; representing
a party of cannibals, as hideous as
fancy could represent them, dancing around
their fire. Johnny diverted his mind and
gratified his malice by doing his best so to
alter the foremost figure as to make him
appear with a wooden leg, while he drew on
his head a straw hat, unmistakably like that
of the old sailor, and touched up the features
so as to give a dim resemblance to his face.
To prevent a doubt as to the meaning of the
sketch, Johnny scribbled on the side of the
picture,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;In search of fierce savages no one need roam;<br /></span>
<span>The fiercest and ugliest, you'll find him at home!&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He secretly showed the picture to Alie.</p>

<p>&quot;O Johnny! how naughty! What would
uncle say if he saw it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We might look out for squalls indeed!
but uncle never by any chance looks at a
book of that sort.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think that you had better rub out the
pencilling as fast as you can,&quot; said Alie.</p>

<p>&quot;Catch me rubbing it out!&quot; cried Johnny;
&quot;it's the best sketch that ever I drew, and as
like the old savage as it can stare!&quot;</p>

<p>Late in the evening their mother returned
from Brampton, where she had been nursing a
sick lady. Right glad were Johnny and Alie
to see her sooner than they had ventured to
expect. She brought them a few oranges, to
show her remembrance of them. Nor was
the old sailor forgotten; carefully she drew
from her bag and presented to him a new
pipe.</p>

<p>The children glanced at each other. Jonas
took the pipe with a curious expression on
his face, which his sister was at a loss to
understand.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank'ee kindly,&quot; he said; &quot;I see it'll
be a case of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;'If ye try and don't succeed,<br /></span>
<span>Try, try, try again.'&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What he meant was a riddle to every one
else present, although not to the reader.</p>

<p>The &quot;try&quot; was very successful on that
evening and the following day. Never had
Johnny and Alie found their uncle so agreeable.
His manner almost approached to
gentleness,&mdash;it was a calm after a storm.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle is so very good and kind,&quot; said
Alie to her brother, as they walked home
from afternoon service, &quot;that I wonder how
you can bear to have that naughty picture
still in your book. He is not in the least
like a cannibal, and it seems quite wrong to
laugh at him so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll rub it all out one of these days,&quot; replied
Johnny; &quot;but I must show it first to
Peter Crane. He says that I never hit on a
likeness: if he sees that, he'll never say so
again!&quot;</p>

<p>The next morning Jonas occupied himself
with gathering wild flowers and herbs in the
fields. He carried them into his little room,
where Johnny heard him whistling &quot;Old
Tom Bowling,&quot; like one at peace with himself
and all the world.</p>

<p>Presently Jonas called to the boy to bring
him a knife from the kitchen; a request
made in an unusually courteous tone of voice,
and with which, of course, Johnny immediately
complied.</p>

<p>He found Jonas busy drying his plants,
by laying them neatly between the pages of
a book, preparatory to pressing them down.
What was the terror of Johnny when he
perceived that the book whose pages Jonas
was turning over for this purpose was no
other than his &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;!</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! if I could only get it out of his
hands before he comes to that horrid picture!
Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?&quot;
thought the bewildered Johnny. &quot;Uncle, I
was reading that book,&quot; at last he mustered
courage to say aloud.</p>

<p>&quot;You may read it again to-morrow,&quot; was
the quiet reply of Jonas.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps he will not look at that picture,&quot;
reflected Johnny. &quot;I wish that I could see
exactly which part of the book he is at! He
looks too quiet a great deal for any mischief
to have been done yet! Dear! dear! I
would give anything to have that 'Robinson
Crusoe' at the bottom of the sea! I do
think that my uncle's face is growing very
red!&mdash;yes! the veins on his forehead are
swelling! Depend on't he's turned over to
those unlucky cannibals, and will be ready
to eat me like one of them! I'd better make
off before the thunder-clap comes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Going to sheer off again, Master Johnny?&quot;
said the old sailor, in a very peculiar tone of
voice, looking up from the open book on
which his finger now rested.</p>

<p>&quot;I've a little business,&quot; stammered out
Johnny.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, a little business with me, which
you'd better square before you hoist sail.
Why, when you made such a good figure of
this savage, did you not clap jacket and boots
on this little cannibal beside him, and make
a pair of 'em 'at home'? I suspect you and
I are both in the same boat as far as regards
our tempers, my lad!&quot;</p>

<p>Johnny felt it utterly impossible to utter
a word in reply.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid,&quot; pursued the seaman, closing
the book, &quot;that we've both had a bit too
much of the savage about us,&mdash;too much of
the dancing round the fire. But mark me,
Jack,&mdash;we learn even in that book that a
savage, a cannibal <i>may</i> be tamed; and we
learn from something far better, that principle,&mdash;the
noblest principle which can govern
either the young or the old,&mdash;<i>may</i>, ay, and
<i>must</i>, put out the fire of fierce anger in our
hearts, and change us from wild beasts to
men! So I've said my say,&quot; added Jonas
with a smile; &quot;and in token of my first
victory over my old foe, come here, my boy,
and give us your hand!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O uncle, I am so sorry!&quot; exclaimed
Johnny, with moistened eyes, as he felt the
kindly grasp of the old man.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry are you? and what were you on
Saturday when I shook you as a cat shakes
a rat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, uncle, I own that I was angry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry now, and angry then? So it's
clear that the mild way has the best effect,
to say nothing of the example.&quot; And Jonas
fell into a fit of musing.</p>

<p>All was fair weather and sunshine in the
home on that day, and on many days after.
Jonas had, indeed, a hard struggle to subdue
his temper, and often felt fierce anger rising
in his heart, and ready to boil over in words
of passion or acts of violence; but Jonas, as
he had endeavoured faithfully to serve his
Queen, while he fought under her flag,
brought the same earnest and brave sense of
duty to bear on the trials of daily life. He
never again forgot his resolution, and every
day that passed made the restraint which he
laid upon himself less painful and irksome
to him.</p>

<p>If the conscience of any of my readers
should tell him that, by his unruly temper,
he is marring the peace of his family, oh!
let him not neglect the evil as a small one,
but, like the poor old sailor in my story,
resolutely struggle against it. For <i>an angry
man stirreth up strife, and a furious man
aboundeth in transgression.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>There is sin in commencing strife;<br /></span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin in the thoughtless jest<br /></span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or angry burst,<br /></span>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
